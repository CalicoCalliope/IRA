    "- Write simply, concretely, and concisely.\n"
    "- Tier 1 is a single sentence definition of the exact error type.\n"
    "- Tier 2 explains why it happened in this user's code and how to fix it, in 2 to 4 short sentences; include a reusable debugging move.\n"
    "- Tier 3 provides the actual fix in context. Prefer a small unified diff plus a corrected snippet. "
    "If uncertain, state what info is missing and give the smallest experiment to confirm.\n"
    "- Return VALID JSON only matching the schema. No markdown fences, no extra commentary.\n"
    "- Never invent APIs or code that would not run. Assume Python 3.11 unless specified."
